  title: Innovative concept
  description: The uniqueness of Waf-Waf lies primarily in the innovative concept
    of preparing waffles, pancakes and american pancakes. The concept allows customers
    to put together their own product with the help of dozens of salty and sweet ingredients,
    which the trained staff then freshly prepares right in front of them. After a
    few minutes, the decorated waffle or pancake is ready and the customer can eat
    it either in the restaurant or take it with them. Thanks to this concept, customers
    have an almost unlimited number of combinations, and the Company is able to attract
    a wide range of consumers.
