The summer menu also got a touch of healthy eating, when we came up with a combination of salty pancakes with halloumi cheese and a special version of the avocado smoothie drink, which will refresh you wonderfully. But what we have to mention is a product that will satisfy every palate. Sweet waffles with caramel-mascarpone sauce and lotus sprinkles are the perfect delight for your taste buds, you just have to taste this!

The menu board also received other novelties prepared by the girls' team at Waf-Waf under the symbolic name WafGirls. The ladies have prepared a waffle burger with chicken strips, a fried pancake with chicken or the unique coffee drink DalgonWaf.

The special offer will run at all branches, so don't hesitate to come and taste what we have prepared for you! We look forward to you.
