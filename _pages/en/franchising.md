    title: Innovative concept
    description: >-
      The uniqueness of Waf-Waf lies primarily in the innovative concept of
      preparing waffles, pancakes and american pancakes. The concept allows
      customers to put together their own product with the help of dozens of
      salty and sweet ingredients, which the trained staff then freshly prepares
      right in front of them. After a few minutes, the decorated waffle or
      pancake is ready and the customer can eat it either in the restaurant or
      take it with them. Thanks to this concept, customers have an almost
      unlimited number of combinations, and the Company is able to attract a
      wide range of consumers.

    title: Waf-Waf as a lovebrand
    description: >-
      Thanks to its focus on quality workmanship and unique decoration, Waf-Waf
      is very popular, especially with the young generation, who like to take
      pictures of food and share it on social networks, which helps the Company
      to create effective viral campaigns. In order to further support this
      customer involvement in marketing, the Company began cooperating with
      well-known Czech influencers, who promote the Waf-Waf brand among their
      wide fan base. The success of this strategy can already be seen today in
      the large number of the Company's fans on social networks, when it has
      over 57,000 +  on its social networks. fans. Waf-Waf has thus become a
      so-called "lovebrand", where its customers become part of the whole
      concept.

    description: >-
      Waf-Waf has managed to build a successful brand out of an innovative
      concept in a short time. The whole concept is very simple and can be
      easily adapted to the location and background. Thus,
      restaurants(FAST-CASUAL CONCEPT) can easily operate in smaller or larger
      premises, regardless of whether it is a shopping center or another stone
      shop. This simple concept, together with Waf-Waf's strong brand and
      know-how, thus offers the ideal combination for the successful franchise
